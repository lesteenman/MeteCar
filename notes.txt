=======

(Please, do them one by one this time)

- Create the admin pages:
 - teams: in admin-only tab
 - active missions page
 - submitted photos page

- Just create all these actions step by stap. Make sure we can:
- Activate/deactivate a mission's team
- Modify a team's members
- Create missions of various types (Bigger feature, of course)
- Activate/Deactivate a mission in general

- At some point in between this, make some simple non-admin views where
  the other users can at least see the data that is being edited by admins.
  Interactability is not yet necessary.

- Implement location missions
- Implement puzzle missions
- Implement photo missions
- Implement photo viewing (just see all of them at first)
- Implement photo rating

- Approve new team members
- Remove team members
