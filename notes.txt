(Please, do them one by one this time)

- submitted photos page

- See a team's submissions, and reject them afterwards
- Add a map to a mission page
- Just create all these actions step by stap. Make sure we can:
- See a team's active/open missions
- Modify a team's members
- Create missions of various types (Bigger feature, of course)

- At some point in between this, make some simple non-admin views where
  the other users can at least see the data that is being edited by admins.
  Interactability is not yet necessary.

- Implement location missions
- Implement puzzle missions
- Implement photo missions
- Implement photo viewing (just see all of them at first)
- Implement photo rating

- Approve new team members
- Remove team members
